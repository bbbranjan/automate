# Examples
Different parts of the algorithm in action.

### Image analysis

The image analysis algorithm detects skin pixels and returns the total percentage of skin pixels in the image as the score. The more skin pixels on display, the greater the promiscuity.

The skin pixel patterns identified by the algorithm can be seen below.

Hollywood superstars Emily Ratajkowski and Bradley Cooper got scores of 12.1% and 28.6% respectively, though that might have something to do with Cooper being shirtless.

### Bio analysis

The RAKE algorithm extracts keywords from a bio, which are then matched with a custom dictionary of keywords to obtain a score for the text. The higher the rating, the greater the promiscuity, as seen in the example above. 

Jane Doe's friendly bio receives a negative score while John Doe gets a very high positive score for his flirty bio.
